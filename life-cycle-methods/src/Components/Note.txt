Conditional Rendering of the ComponentUnmount: The ComponentUnmount component will only render if the counter state is greater than 5 (this.state.counter > 5). However, it’s important to remember that componentWillUnmount will only be triggered when the component is about to be removed from the DOM. So, the component will unmount only when the counter state goes from greater than 5 back to a value of 5 or lower.

In your current code, you are adding 1 to the counter each time the user clicks the <h3> element, but once counter becomes greater than 5, the ComponentUnmount will render. The componentWillUnmount method will be triggered when counter goes back to 5 or below, which is not happening in the current flow.

Solution:
To fix this, you can modify your code so that the ComponentUnmount component properly unmounts when the counter goes back down to a value that’s less than or equal to 5.

For example, you can add a button to decrement the counter, which would trigger the unmounting of ComponentUnmount when the counter goes back to 5 or lower.

Here's the updated code:

LifeCycleMethods Component:
jsx
Copy code
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ComponentUnmount from "./ComponentUnmount";

class LifeCycleMethods extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    console.log("Constructor");
    this.state = {
      counter: 0,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component Did Mount");
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    console.log("After Each render ComponentDidUpdate Called");
  }

  render() {
    console.log("Render method is called");
    return (
      <>
        <h2>Life Cycle Methods of Components</h2>
        <h3
          onClick={() => {
            this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 });
          }}
        >
          Counter value - {this.state.counter}
        </h3>

        <button
          onClick={() => {
            this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter - 1 });
          }}
        >
          Decrement Counter
        </button>

        {this.state.counter > 5 ? <ComponentUnmount /> : null}
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default LifeCycleMethods;
ComponentUnmount Component:
jsx
Copy code
import React, { Component } from "react";

class ComponentUnmount extends React.Component {
  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log("Component Will Unmount Called");
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h3>Component Unmounted</h3>
      </>
    );
  }
}

export default ComponentUnmount;
Explanation of Changes:
Decrement Button: I added a button to decrement the counter. This will allow you to decrease the counter value and see the componentWillUnmount method being triggered when it goes below 5.
Conditional Rendering: The ComponentUnmount will only be rendered when counter is greater than 5. As soon as the counter is clicked to go below or equal to 5, it will unmount and trigger the componentWillUnmount.
This should now show componentWillUnmount being logged in the console when you decrease the counter.
